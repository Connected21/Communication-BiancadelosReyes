             How would you go about persuading someone to see things your way at work? How would you go about explaining a complex idea/problem to a client who was already frustrated? What would you do if you there was a breakdown in communication at work?

        <div class="content-inner">
          <p>
            To communicate effectively, you need to avoid distractions and stay focused. Inconsistent body language. Nonverbal communication should reinforce what is being said, not contradict it. If you say one thing, but your body language says something else, your listener will likely feel that you're being dishonest.

      <h3>How do you develop communication skills?</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="content-inner">
          <p>
            <ul><li>Make communication a priority. Take classes, read books, magazine articles or learn from successful communicators around you.</li><li>Simplify and stay on message. Use simple, straightforward language. Remember that Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address was 286 words, about two minutes long.</li><li>Engage your listeners or readers. Draw your listeners and readers into the conversation. Ask questions and invite opinions. Solicit their feedback.</li><li>Take time to respond. After you’ve listened (and understood) take time to “draft” in your head what you want to say.</li><li>Make sure you are understood. Don’t blame the other person for not understanding. Instead, look for ways to clarify or rephrase what you are trying to say so it can be understood.</li><li>Develop your listening skills, too. The best communicators are almost always the best listeners. Listen without judgment and don’t be distracted by thinking about what you want to say next. Then, respond, not react.</li><li>Body language is important. Studies show that 65% of all communication is non-verbal. Watch for visual signs that your listener understands, agrees or disagrees with your message. And be aware that your body is sending signals, too.</li><li>Maintain eye contact. Whether speaking to a crowd or one-on-one, maintaining eye contact builds credibility and demonstrates you care about your listeners.</li></ul>

            Sample answer: I am a great communicator. I can present my ideas well in-person, in writing and through social media. I've worked hard to sharpen those skills because I feel that the value of a great idea is lost if I can't present it in a way that others can understand.
