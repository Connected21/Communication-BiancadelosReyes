    <h2>What is Communication?</h2>
    
    
    <p>Communications is the use of messages to generate meaning, both within and across a myriad of cultures, contexts, channels, and media. Through the effective practice of communications, we are able to improve cultural, social, personal, and professional experiences, whether between individual, enterprises or even nations.</p>
    
    
    <blockquote>Words are singularly the most powerful force available to humanity. We can choose to use this force constructively with words of encouragement, or destructively using words of despair. Words have energy and power with the ability to help, to heal, to hinder, to hurt, to harm, to humiliate and to humble.<br><small>Yuhada Berg</small></blockquote>
    
    <p>
      The effective and ethical practice of communications through language, behaviors, sounds, words, and symbols is vital to the advancement of a civilized society. It allows us to reach mutual understandings and overcome barriers in political settings, social movements, and our everyday lives. It advances culture, facilitates business, changes perceptions, and provides insight—and that’s just the beginning.</p>

  <h2>The Essential Components of Communication</h2>
  
  
  
  <p>Communication is a continuous, two-way process, which includes a message that must be conveyed through a medium to a recipient. The recipient must understand the message and respond within a specific time frame. Therefore, communication studies involve a process that can be broken down into a series of essential components, which include:</p>
  
  <p><img src="res/essential.jpg"></p>

  <p><b>Source:</b> The source is the person who imagines, creates, and sends the message.</p>
  <p><b>Message:</b> The message is the stimulus or meaning produced by the source for the receiver or audience.</p>
  <p><b>Channel:</b> The channel is the way in which a message travels between the source and the receiver.</p>
  <p><b>Receiver:</b> The receiver receives the message from the source and analyzes and interprets the message—both intended and unintended—from the source.</p>
  <p><b>Feedback:</b> Feedback is the verbal and/or nonverbal response to a message.</p>
  <p><b>Environment:</b> The environment is the physical and psychological aspects of the communication’s context.</p>
  <p><b>Context:</b> Context involves the setting, scene, and expectations of the individuals involved.</p>
  <p><b>Interference:</b>  Interference is anything that blocks or changes the source’s intended meaning of the message.</p>
