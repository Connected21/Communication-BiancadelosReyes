    <h2>What Is a Communication Plan?</h2>
    
    
    <p>A communication plan is a specific strategy which defines your company’s audiences as well as the messages you need to communicate to them in order to achieve your mutual business goals. In simple terms, it is a document that outlines when, how, and why you’ll communicate with your audiences.</p>
    
    <h5><b>Here are some basic questions a good communication plan should aim to answer:</b></h5>

    <p>
      <ul>
  <li>What is the message you wish to communicate to your target audience?</li><li>What details do you want to share with them about your company?</li><li>What’s your company’s mission?</li></p>

  <p><img src="res/what.jpg"></p>

  <h5>8 Steps to a Perfect Communication Plan (Template)</h5>

  <p><b>1. Clearly identify your mission statement</b></p>
  <p>Your company’s mission statement should clearly communicate what it is that you do. It’s usually a short sentence or paragraph that explains to the world why it is that your business exists.</p>
  <p>Your mission statement states the ultimate goal your business aims to achieve for your customers. So, the first step in the creation of your communication plan should be re-emphasizing your own mission statement. Here are several examples of mission statements of some major companies to get you inspired:</p>

 <p> <ul>
  <li>Starbucks – “To inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.”</li><li>LeadQuizzes – “Make marketing easier.”</li><li>Nike: “To bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.”</li></p>

  <p><b>2. Define your business goals</b></p>

  <p>The next step would be to identify your business goals. In other words – what is it that your company needs to do or what goals it needs to achieve in order to consider your business dealings a success?</p>

  <p>Every goal you set is expected to contribute to your business’ overall objectives and should be a step forward to fulfilling the promise stated in your mission statement. Your business goals should be listed (and elaborated) in your communication plan template.</p>

  <h2>The Essential Components of Communication</h2>
  
  
  
  <p>Communication is a continuous, two-way process, which includes a message that must be conveyed through a medium to a recipient. The recipient must understand the message and respond within a specific time frame. Therefore, communication studies involve a process that can be broken down into a series of essential components, which include:</p>
  
  <p><img src="res/essential.jpg"></p>

  <p><b>Source:</b> The source is the person who imagines, creates, and sends the message.</p>
  <p><b>Message:</b> The message is the stimulus or meaning produced by the source for the receiver or audience.</p>
  <p><b>Channel:</b> The channel is the way in which a message travels between the source and the receiver.</p>
  <p><b>Receiver:</b> The receiver receives the message from the source and analyzes and interprets the message—both intended and unintended—from the source.</p>
  <p><b>Feedback:</b> Feedback is the verbal and/or nonverbal response to a message.</p>
  <p><b>Environment:</b> The environment is the physical and psychological aspects of the communication’s context.</p>
  <p><b>Context:</b> Context involves the setting, scene, and expectations of the individuals involved.</p>
  <p><b>Interference:</b>  Interference is anything that blocks or changes the source’s intended meaning of the message.</p>
